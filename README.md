# StockData-Project

üìö Overview
StockData Project is a stock market analysis application focused on historical data collection, filtering, and visualization.
Using Python and the yfinance library, stock price data for the year 2024 was extracted and saved into an SQLite database.
A custom stock screener enables filtering companies based on key financial indicators like P/E ratio, revenue, free cash flow, and price changes.
The data is visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore operational strength, valuation metrics, historical prices, and detailed company profiles.
